3. 
it comes to a "Segmentation fault (core dumped)" result, and the program isn't able to run.

4. 
now it's able to run, 
with input "./lab2 3000", it prints 100 parent processes and 100 child processes, indexing from 0 to 99.
and with input "./lab2 500", it prints the same output, but in a faster speed, as we now have smaller delay.
lastly with input "./lab2 5000", we have a longer wait time as expected.
Overall, inputting 500 gives the shortest waitting time, 3000 gives the second shortest, and 5000 gives the longest as expected.

6. 
inorder to execute this file, we need to attach a "-lpthread" at the end of the gcc command, so "gcc lab2_6.c -o lab2_6 -lpthread".
and as before, we also need to input a number as our delay input along with ./lab2_6 to successfully run this code, and the result is similar.

7. 
we successfully have the ls command at the end.
